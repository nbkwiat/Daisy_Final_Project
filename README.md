# `Daisy_Final_Project` <br/>
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Fortunately, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning, and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. <br/>
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/credit-card-approval-clean-data?resource=download)  and our task is to predict which people in the dataset are successful in applying for a credit card. <br/>
### Communication protocols  <br/>
To effective group collaboration & teamwork we’ve done following: <br/>
-	Defined roles and outlines for the deliverable
-	Created direct messages for only team members in Slack.
