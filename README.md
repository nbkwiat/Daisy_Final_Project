# `Daisy_Final_Project` <br/

Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk. <br/>
The purpose of Daisy_Final_Project is to apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world challenge: Credit Card Approval Prediction. <br/>
